Purpose and Design Philosophy: 

Mirage is a command line python script which is meant to interact with the the Web-Based Graphic User Interaface (Web GUI) 
by sending data through UDP packages, ultimately mimicking data being sent to the flight computer. 

The design philosophy behind the following program is the act of "hoodle", or hardware out of the loop testing. 
Given the spacial limitations fo the lap, we cannot always  ave the MOTE lying out at all times. 
By creating a program which allows the MOTE's behaviors to be remotely accessiable at all times, I hope the following are achieved: 

1) Significant amounts of time when testing firmware and software 

2) Allow for flexibility by offering a remote option for projects which may involve physically connecting MOTE during the testing phase p
